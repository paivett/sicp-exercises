; As explained in previous exercises, the rules of algebra for real numbers does not apply when dealing with these intervals
; which represent a real with an error associated. The uncertainty, or error, changes with every operation performed, so
; it is impossible to come up with a computation way that is inmune to this. The person writing this formulations must be
; aware of this fact and try to write the computation in a way that keeps the error to a minimum. This is just as multiplying
; matrices or vectors, for example, where product (or cross=product) is not conmutative.
